\maketitle

Circle graphs have become an increasingly popular visualization tool to depict genomic data and other concept relationships derived from large datasets both in academic and mainstream publications \cite{aumann99}, \cite{krzywinski09}. In its most basic form, each category is arranged on the circle’s perimeter. Lines drawn through the center connect categories that share a relationship.  A circle graph may be extended to include additional information by weighing connectors via color or line thickness to map the strength of a relationship. Other plots summarizing information regarding a specific category may be displayed on a concentric axis just outside the circle’s perimeter.

A major challenge when visualizing large datasets is the need to balance disparate scales. The existence of relationship trends between categories can only be seen when displaying entire data set while the nature of individual relationships and any supplementary information regarding a single category is better suited for a much smaller scale. These two perspectives provide a strong argument for distinct visualizations when presented as static graphics, while separate images places the burden of cognitive load of comparison and relatedness on the reader. 

In the case of many relationships across the circle, overplotting occurs and the order in which the lines are drawn affects the message to reader. Key relationships may be completely obfuscated due to an abundance of non-informative connections. While it is possible to select a color scheme to highlight relationships of interest, this technique may only be applied with a priori knowledge of a connection’s importance, information which is not available during exploratory analysis.

Stacked bar graphs display the total number of observations for a particular variable, colored by the category of an individual observation. Within the single bar
In contrast hammock plots, designed specifically for instances of categorical data and those of mixed categorical and continuous data \cite{hammock} allow for linear comparisons. Categories are displayed as a series of univariate labels, grouped  by variable. Related categories that are measures of the same variable. Connections are drawn as a bicariage graph of rectangles where the width is proportional to interaction.  In the case where rectangles are of width zero (lines), the hammock plot simplifies to the special case of parallel coordinate plots. Of particular interest when applying hamock plots to large datasets is the ability to minimize line crossings - each bivariate graphing region only displays information regarding two variables, which is a maximum of (n\_var1)(n\_var2) - 1 crossings. This is many orders of magnitudes less than $\Pi_{i = 1}^{nvar}n_{i} - 1$ possible crossings that may occur if all connections are displayed in the same region, as for circle graphs.
\section{Methods}
\paragraph{Data Preprocessing}
We first identified three datasets: set A is the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized by travelling class, gender, age and survival \cite{titanic}. Set B is the 8 x 8 table found on the Circos website \cite{circosdata}. Set C is the gene pathway information compiled via KEGG \cite{KEGG12} \cite{KEGG00} and UCSC genome browser \cite{ucsc02} \cite{ucsc10}. Genes involved in human metabolism were identified using the KEGG database and the Bioconductor package KEGG.db \cite{keggdb} was used to map

\paragraph{Generating figures}
\paragraph{User Study} To compare the effectiveness of hammock plots versus circle graphs, we performed a user study of XX participants, X female and Y male ranging in age from a to b.  Participants first shown the same short tutorial explaining the features of each plot type (circle graph, hammock plot). The plots were then shown using data set ordering A, B, C, and random assignment of plot type (circular graph, horizontal hammock plot and vertical hammock plot). Each participant viewed a total of three graphs viewing each data set and each plot type exactly once . For data set A, participants were asked: ????? ... No time limit restriction was placed on the tester, but time spent on each question was collected.
