"R_3ZQvAmasceYQPQM","3","The circle graph was too small to be readable, was missing labels (receivers and transmitters?), had multiple connections between the same two segments of the circle, and the end points of the connections were too far apart to easily compare visually.  I found it difficult to compare some of the data across the stacked bars. I found it easiest to answer the posed questions using the hammock plot, but there was much fewer data points presented in that plot, so it may not scale up to the same amount of data as was presented in the other two charts.","Chrome","Linux x86_64","2012-04-26 23:06:08","17.27","1200","1600","bar","C","3","297.11","7",3,4
"R_bvGXdKWl3ICupP6","1","The difficulty of each was strongly influenced by the number of parameters being evaluated. There were relatively few things to observe on the bar graphs compared to the other charts. If the number of relations being presented were equal on all of them, I think the bar graphs would be nearly impossible to understand. However, other minor details hindered this study. The lettering on the hammock plot would have been more intuitive if it had been alphabetical, left to right. Also, some questions required very careful reading in order to understand exactly what was being requested. Even then, I'm still not sure I interpreted what you wanted for the last circle graph question correctly.","Chrome","WOW64","2012-04-26 22:52:27","43.7","900","1600","circos","C","3","723.89","15",3,6

"R_ekPM1Syz0w3SC9K","2","First, for the circle chart, you ask how many survivors there are, but don't explicitly state that ""yes"" means ""surviving"". Also, they images were too small. I had to download them and zoom in to read the numbers and see all the lines. There was no explanation given for the bar charts. Is the first row the total number of emittence events received by each receiver? That's how I interpreted it, but that's not the only way I could have. Also, when asking about the ""receiver category"", do you want us to look at the bottom plot? There was not enough explained about what we were looking at to acurately evaluate this plot.  For the Hammock plot, details of the smaller relationships are not able to be seen.","Firefox","WOW64","2012-04-26 17:43:03","16.37","1200","1600","hammock","C","3","128.38","7",3,3
